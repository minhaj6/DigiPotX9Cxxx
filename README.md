# DigiPotX9Cxxx

When searching for an arduino library to control X9Cxxx family digital potentiometers, found some old 2011 forum post that posted some code snippets that does just that. Unfortunately this library was not available under arduino IDE's library manager. So I decided to put it in there.

Oliver from Playduino has a great demonstration on the use this library - https://youtu.be/Zy50ZGSJLqM?si=lQrcnnuoCwkD3tID
